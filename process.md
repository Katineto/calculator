Needs to be fixed:
=================
    * Display overflow when there are more than 22 characters
    * Show result of calculation
    * Clear display after calculation
    * Show current operator
    * Add keybord support
    * Add warning message for dividing by 0


    Calculation algorithm:
    -user types in first number, it is stored in a variable, number border - any operator
    -user types an operator, it is stored in a variable
    -second number is stored in a variable, border - button "="
    -function calculate() is called, result is put in a first number variable
